<p>I haven't written a note in a while. A couple weeks I'd say. And it's not that I don't know what to talk about or that I don't want to. It's just that in life you are given 24 hours each day, and you have to figure out what to do of these 24 hours and writing a new note wasn't it for a while.</p>

<p>My brain is constantly spewing out ideas, be it new pages to make, notes to write, silly songs to sing, stuff to take in pictures or to draw. And yet I only have so much time to fit it all.</p>

<p>And making out priorities is really hard. You have to constantly battle between what you should do, what you could do and what you actually want to do. And sometimes what you want to do is the furthest away from what you should do and then you feel like crap when you do it.<br />
Like when I really want to watch that hour long video but then that's an hour I won't spend creating.</p>

<p>And I feel like creating has been the driving force in my life for a long time, I've always created stuff, whatever it may be. From stories to play with my toys to making cool websites. And there are so many things to create and so many ideas to bring to life that it is always overwhelming to make a choice about what to do.</p>

<p>So I often find refuge in browsing the web, watching series, reading books, etc. All fun but non creative activities; activities that barely ask me to make any choice and where the effort and brain power demanded is minimal.</p>

<p>Maybe the solution would be to choose one thing, only one, and force myself to do that. This means leaving out the other ones, or at least not prioritizing them, but I think that will at least enable me to progress in one area.<br />
And the area I'm most preoccupied by these days is this blog you are reading. So from today onwards, I'm gonna try to block of 30min every morning where all I do is writing.
It can be a blog article, or it can be the rest of my journal that I probably wasn't able to finish the previous evening.</p>

<p>We'll see how that goes, I'll keep you posted, bye üëã</p>

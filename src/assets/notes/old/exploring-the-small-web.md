Yesterday I discovered the _Internet phone book_, and I was really excited to buy one because this project really resonates with me.  
Unfortunately, it is sold out pretty much everywhere and I'm not going to the USA or Greece to get one (though I wish I could).

Despite this, I still had a thorough look at <a href="https://internetphonebook.net/" target="_blank">the website</a>, and I discovered that they have a <a href="https://internetphonebook.net/#dial-a-site" target="_blank">phone</a> you can use to "call" the sites from the book!  
So what I do now, when I want to take a break but don't want to mindlessly browser twitter, is dial a random number and visit the site. It almost always leads to a deep rabbit hole and I discover many new cool places on the internet.

One other project I know about that works on a similar principle is <a href="https://theforest.link/" target="_blank">_the forest_</a>. You have a button and it teleports you to a random site somewhere!  

If you know of other places like these ones that can be used to explore the <a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/" target="_blank">small web</a>, I'd be pleased if you can <a href="mailto:hello@theoo.dev">let me know</a> and I will be sure to add them to the list on this page :))

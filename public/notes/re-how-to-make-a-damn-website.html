<p><em>This post is a reply to <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/how-to-make-a-damn-website.html">this article</a> by <a href="https://lmnt.me/">Louie Mantia</a>, go check his website out, it's really cool!</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is my first reply post! 🎉 How exciting!!</p>

<p>TLDR; for those that don't want to go read it:<br />
To make a damn website, you write <code>html</code>, <code>css</code>, and your <code>rss</code> feed manually. Repeat stuff on different pages. All manual.</p>
<p>So that's what I did! This website is now fully static and only using <code>html</code> files.<br />
I would just like to add my opinion after trying this approach to nuance Louie's article a bit.</p>
<p>First of all, I think that making a website with <code>html</code> is a great idea, especially for a personal website. It's super easy to ship and to change stuff, you don't spend any time configuring things or stuck in dependency hell 🔥.<br />
I feel like I've finally gotten close again to the publishing power I had with my <code>.txt</code> only website but with the added bonus of accessibility!</p>
<p>This approach brings one problem though, writing <code>html</code> sucks ass. When I'm writing a post, I don't want to have to think about tags and semantics. I want to write words and be able to scan them quickly without tags and attributes getting in the way.<br />
Also, it's absolute hell on mobile (though you might be aided by a tool like James' <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2025/08/17/designing-a-mobile-first-html-editor">mobile first html editor</a>). I don't want to have to go in the keyboard behind the keyboard and type all the symbols necessary for a <code>html</code> tag. And I write a LOT on my phone because I don't always have my computer on me when I have the time to write.</p>
<p>So the solution I've found to this problem is to write my files in <code>markdown</code><sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> (using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>) and simply parse them using a tool like this <a href="https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/dingus/">PHP Markdown Dingus</a><sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> and then copy them inside my <code>html</code> files.<br />
This way I can write both on my phone and my computer without being distracted by having to think about correct <code>html</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from that tiny caveat, I encourage everyone to start building their own website, it's so much fun and actually really easy once you've gone through the deployment phase.<br />
If you have a personal website, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@theoo.dev">share it with me</a>! I'd be more than pleased to have a look :))</p>

<p>But it could also be <code>txt</code> or whatever you want that doesn't have a terse syntax.&#160;<a href="#fnref1:1" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>I've personally built a tiny app (with PHPNative) that adds a global shortcut that uses <a href="https://github.com/erusev/parsedown-extra">ParsedownExtra</a> to convert my markdown.&#160;<a href="#fnref1:2" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">&#8617;</a></p>

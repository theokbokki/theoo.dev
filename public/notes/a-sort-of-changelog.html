<p>Since my last post, I still haven't written anything, but I've been thinking a lot and working on other bits of this website. In this post, I would like to address some of the things that have changed, evolved or disappeared on this website lately.</p>

<p>All these changes were sparked by my realization that Weeknotes were (almost) the only things I was posting and I wanted to write other stuff. So at first I decided to try adding a journal page were I would add a summary of my day every day, but it quickly turned into a chore and didn't fix the problem of finding the time to write other stuff. I dropped the idea, but the page is still there and I'm still thinking on what to do with it. Maybe I'll try my hand at some fictional writing? Who knows.</p>

<p>Then I took a step back and realized that what I liked about Weeknotes was mostly reading them on other people's websites, but not really write my own. And the enjoyable part mostly came from sharing links at the end of each week.</p>

<p>So I decided to build a <a href="/links.html">links page</a>. It has a pretty simple design and is a bit laborious to keep up (Since I've decided to add an image for each link) but I like it quite a lot!
I'll had links there from time to time, probably in batches when I find the courage to go through my backlog.</p>

<p>Another thing I've been trying to have on this website for a while is images. I like the idea of sharing your life through images like on Instagram. But I hate Instagram, Meta sucks, social medias suck.<br />
So instead I built my own <a href="/memories.html">memories page</a>. It's an infinite canvas where I can upload images and play around with them. I hope I'm able to keep it up this time, because I love the end result but I hate tending to it, it's a bit of a weird relationship I have with images.</p>

<p>The 'Books I read' note I used to have is now gone in favor of an actual bookshelf! You can find it on the <a href="/books.html">books page</a></p>

<p>So here's a recap of how my website is structured as of now:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://theoo.dev">/</a> — The homepage, used as an index for notes, snippets and other pages</li>
<li><a href="https://theoo.dev/links.html">/links</a> — The index for all the links I want to share. It can be anything from cool websites to articles to recipes.</li>
<li><a href="https://theoo.dev/memories.html">/memories</a> — The page where I store my images, so I can look at them later.</li>
<li><a href="https://theoo.dev/books.html">/books</a> — My personal library of books I've read, I really like the way it looks</li>
</ul>

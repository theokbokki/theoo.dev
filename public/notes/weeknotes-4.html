<p>Wow it's already been a month since my first Weeknotes! Time really files ^^</p>

<h2>WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK</h2>

<ul>
<li>Neko update! We have had huge progress this week, we took the tram for the first time and it went somewhat alright. She was scared but managed it (Even let a random lady pet her). We also walked a bunch on the <em>foire</em> and in the city and she actually walked without stopping too much.<br />
There was also progress in the potty department as there was no accident for the past 3 days!</li>
<li>We got a <a href="https://www.campsnapphoto.com/fr/blogs/camp-snap-news/campsnap-version-105-update-what-s-new-why-it-says-105">CampSnap</a> camera to take cool crappy pictures. Well actually, we got 2, the first one had a broken IR filter and was taking all pink pictures üò¨ It's a pretty nice camera, I might make a post reviewing it at some point! That would be exciting I think.</li>
<li>I've had to work on something super fun at work. We have this <a href="https://hiker.dev/">PHP/Laravel package</a> that allows you to create admin interfaces and it has a Grid component to allow you to position stuff however you like. And I got to refactor it to make it much less verbose and more flexible.</li>
<li>I've eaten quite a lot of great tasting food this week and I can't be grateful enough for the existence of it. Being vegan really isn't that hard. This week we're going to eat homemade vegan <em>Boulets Li√©geois</em> and I'm so excited OMG.</li>
<li>I wish there was a soundboard integrated into Slack so I could share random memes with my colleagues as reactions to their messages. So I started building my own clone just to add this feature üëπ I don't know if it's gonna lead anywhere, we'll see ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</li>
</ul>

<h2>LINKS OF THE WEEK</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://jpolak.org/photo/best-macos-text-editors/">https://jpolak.org/photo/best-macos-text-editors/</a><br />
Hates AI ‚úÖ Has great taste in editors ‚úÖ Takes cool pictures ‚úÖ. This is a great article, I totally agree with what he says. I'm a Neovim guy myself, but I love to dabble around looking for other editors.</li>
<li><a href="https://romi.link/journal">https://romi.link/journal</a><br />
I love reading about other people's life and feelings. Romi's journal really captures that and her art is absolutely lovely. Big plus for how simple the website looks as well!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.door.link/">https://www.door.link</a><br />
Another project of Romi. I love it, the music mixtapes are just immaculate, I enjoy it way way too much :)) </li>
</ul>

<p>I can't promise anything but I think there will be MANY more links next week. I have a huge backlog of open pages on my phone. It will depend on if I read <em>Monsieur Madame</em> books or if I go online.</p>

<h2>WHAT I LISTENED TO THIS WEEK</h2>

<h3>PODCASTS</h3>

<ul>
<li>Potterless<br />
It's a somewhat old podcast about a dude who knows not much about Harry Potter and who reads and critiques the books for the first time. I love it it's really fun</li>

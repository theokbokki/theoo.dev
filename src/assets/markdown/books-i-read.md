This page is a list of books I've read, and those I'm currently reading. 
Most books I read are in French and may not have been translated in English (or I couldn't find a translated edition) hence the French titles.  
I purposefuly don't include ratings or opinions, this is just a simple list.

Don't hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:hello@theoo.dev) if you have books to recommend :))

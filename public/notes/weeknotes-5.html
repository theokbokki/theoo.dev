<p>Hey üëã Hope you are doing great! 
This week is up for a little change, I'm gonna stop dividing these Weeknotes into "parts" like "what I listened to", "what I read" etc.
They are gonna become more like an organic list of things that I did this week with all the different stuff mixed in.</p>

<p>Only part I'm keeping separate is the <em>Links of the week</em> part that you can find at the end :))</p>

<h2>WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK</h2>

<p>I started watching <em>La Star Academy</em>... At first, it was pure hate-listening on the side as my SO was listening to it in the background. But eventually I got caught into it and now we watch it together ^^</p>

<p>I finally finished the book I had been stuck on for months <em>The travelling cat chronicles</em>. It's a great book and I thoroughly enjoyed it but OMG is it sad!!! I think that Japanese authors are the best at conveying emotions, maybe because Japanese is a good language for that.</p>

<p>I added two pages to this website, and I think they are really cool!<br />
There is a <a href="/memories.html">memories</a> page which is a large (10000px by 10000px)  canvas where I can drag and drop images to come back to them later. I made it all using HTML CSS and Vanilla JS which taught me about using JS to animate elements instead of CSS (√† la GSAP) and it's actually super simple! Normally, it also works on mobile and if you have JS disabled :))
<img src="/assets/img/memories.webp" alt="A picture of my memories website. It's a large dotted canvas with images you can drag around." /></p>

<p>And I also made a <a href="/books.html">books</a> page which comes to replace the note I had listing all the books I read. I got inspired by <a href="https://x.com/mymind/status/1981787228859744462">this tweet</a> and decided to try to do something akin to the old Delicious Library but with a more sleek modern touch. I ended up with this.

<p>I went on a lot of longer walks in the city's outskirts with Neko and it is much funnier than going to the park. We still meet plenty of dogs, grass and other humans, but we get the benefit of seeing/discovering cool places in a city that I already know so well.<br />
It's always fun when you see a random moss covered staircase as you are going down a street and decide to take it to see where it leads, all that to end up in that other street you knew about but never imagined there was a shortcut to.<br />
Or how lovely it is to simply walk along the river's edge with Neko chasing ducks and pigeons. Going to a Caf√© you know is closed (because it's sunday evening) but still, a quest is a quest.<br />
I've been greatly enjoying the company of the dog. Walks are much slower, like 2 to 3 times slower, but I get someone to talk to that is always listening and doesn't think I'm crazy for talking out loud alone in the street (or at least, I hope Neko doesn't think I'm crazy).</p>

<p>My cats are starting to get their winter coat again, and it's the cutest thing in the world. They look so fluffy and light! Also, since it's colder, they've been getting way more cuddly as a way to heat up. Sometimes this makes it hard to work when they decide the trackpad is the best place to lay, but it's so wonderful to have these little creatures sleeping in your arms. Cats are so great I can't fathom that some people don't like them!</p>

<p>I've gotten a new book by accident. As we were walking with Neko, I noticed a <em>boite √† livre</em> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and it had a copy of <em>Caligula</em> by Albert Camus. I thought this book was nice and picked it up.</p>

<p>There is a new Caf√© in town, it's called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/balio.cafe/">Bali√¥</a> and was recommended to me by <a href="https://jonathanrixhon.dev/">Jonathan</a>. It's pretty, nice, and they accept dogs! Plus my cappuccino was pleasant.<br />
If you are into great specialty coffee or filter coffee, I wouldn't go there. But if you are looking to spend a great time with nice people and a lovely place, I definitely would!<br />
My SO said their tiramisu tastes great.</p>

<h2>WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK</h2>
<ul>
<li>Neko update üêï Things are going great, we keep slowly figuring things out and get more bounded every day that passes.<br />
We've had a bit of problems with sleep patterns (Waking up at 3AM is never fun) but it seems to have gotten back on track.</li>
<li>The menu bar app I was working on last week is finished! It works super well and converts files as intended. I've also been working on a simple other one which is basically a global shortcut that uses <a href="https://github.com/erusev/parsedown-extra">ParsedownExtra</a> to convert markdown to html but more about this in an other post!</li>
<li>The <em>Foire</em> has officially started and I'm already tired of it. Living 100m away from roller coasters is not the funniest thing in the world ://</li>
<li>I've been in the process of re-writing this website AGAIN! But this time, there is no way I can simplify it further without compromising accessibility I think.</li>
</ul>
<h2>LINKS OF THE WEEK</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://birming.com/2025/09/21/publish-dont-polish/">https://birming.com/2025/09/21/publish-dont-polish/</a><br />
Hard agree and this is the way I run my own website. I always publish stuff when I feel like it and we'll see about improvements later.</li>
<li><a href="https://rscottjones.com/getting-the-most-out-of-a-bad-situation/">https://rscottjones.com/getting-the-most-out-of-a-bad-situation/</a><br />
An interesting perspective about life that I had never really thought about but am gonna try to implement.</li>
<li><a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/lockfiles/">https://tonsky.me/blog/lockfiles/</a><br />
Had never though about lockfiles this way, to me they seemed ubiquitous, but this totally changed my opinion! I'm glad this website runs on super simple tech that doesn't need no packages.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.holovaty.com/writing/chatgpt-fake-feature/">https://www.holovaty.com/writing/chatgpt-fake-feature/</a><br />
This is weird, I don't like that we bow to AI... But at the same time, it must be driving new customers to their app, which is a good this I guess. I don't know what I think about this.</li>
<li><a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/">https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/</a><br />
A useful, funny and instructive article about centering things on the web and in apps. I had never realized this was such an issue and I learned a lot reading this article.</li>
</ul>
<h2>WHAT I WATCHED THIS WEEK</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gilmore Girls<br />
This is our first time watching this series and I must say that it has probably become my favourite series ever! The cast, the story, the puns, the emotions, the 2000s vibe, everything is perfect and I'm loving every second of it!<br />
I wish they still used old cameras to film current stuff, this gives it such a cozy vibe...</li>
</ul>
<h2>WHAT I LISTENED TO THIS WEEK</h2>
<h3>MUSIC</h3>
<ul>
<li>JeanJass ‚Äî <em>Goldman</em> &amp; <em>Tous ces ongles rong√©s</em>
Two phenomenal rap albums, both no skips. Goldman has been on repeat for the whole week.</li>
<li>Aupinard<br />
He's a staple of my listening and I could almost put him in the list every week. I discovered Bossa Nova because of him and I just love is way of blending genres.<br />
I'm gonna see him in concert in March next year :))</li>
<li>Caballero ‚Äì <em>Dose H√©ro√Øque</em><br />
An album I weirdly enjoy listening to while I work, I don't know why. Some of the punchlines are absolutely delightful, the prods are great.</li>
<li>Hologram Lo' &amp; Jungle Jack ‚Äî <em>CREAMLAND</em><br />
Hologram Lo' has cooked soooooo hard on the prods for this album. </li>
<li>Salut C'est Cool ‚Äî Sur le th√®me des grands d√©couvertes
I was low on sugar and had to bring back groceries. This never disappoints and is quite trippy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>WHAT I DESIGNED THIS WEEK</h2>
<p>I made a text editor in the style of Arc, Dia, Zen,... because I love the look of these! I wish it could exist but I don't have the skills to do a code editor ://</p>

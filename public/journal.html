    This is the begining of my journal! So hi to whoever is reading this ^^
I'm currently on holiday so I'm taking things easy. This morning after walking Neko and making my coffee, I finished and published this website!
Then we went to get another coffee at Kawa, this coffee shop is only open during the week when I work so I was happy to go there. But since they changed location, they stopped making filter coffee. So I was dissapointed and didn't take anything there.

    Instead, we went to this other coffee I had meant to try for years, Grand Maison. The place is super cool and I love their website, it's simple but really cute. Also, they accept dogs, and that's a great plus!!! There, they do make filter coffee, and it was great. Chocolatey and not bitter at all, a bit too watery for my taste but nothing too bad.
I hope to go there again soon and maybe we can sit inside this time, the place looks super nice and the staff was lovely.

    After that, we got caught in the rain while coming home. But it was like you know, this super wet rain, the kind of thin, cold, hard hitting, spitty rain. I know it might seem dumb to call rain wet, but I swear that some rain is wetter than some other rain. Come to Belgium for a year, you'll see.
Neko hates the rain and being wet, but she was brave and kept walking and being nice even when we took the tram. I'm really happy about the way she's growing and I feel like most of the worries I had in the first few weeks are now behind me :))

    For dinner, I had gnocchi with bell pepper, tomato paste, cream and a plentifull amount of garlic. It was great, the texture was perfect. After that I finished house cleaning, went to get groceries for tonight's dinner and a carrot cake.
Then there was more walking with Neko but this time she was awful because she'd found some food and wouldn't accept to go anywhere else than where the food was. So we cut it short and went home with loads of pulling and kibble throwing.

    By the time I came home, it was basically time to watch today's Star Academy summary. I'm almost ashamed to say it, but I'm starting to like this show more and more. There is still some hate watching, like, I still critique everything like I know better and it's a lot of fun. My favourite rn is Victor but tbh it's not like a real real favourite, I wouldn't care who wins, I'm not that invested (yet).

    Tonight we are eating fried rice with kimchi (I'm making it as I write these lines), I love this meal, it tastes super good, the vinegary taste of it is on point and yayyy more garlic!!

    Now (Yeah time moved between the previous sentence and this one) we are watching the animated series "Haunted Hotel". I've only seen the first episode so far but I quite like it. I've always enjoyed these kind of dark but fun but adult but childish series, and I'm a big fan of cartoon stuff. I might try my hand at drawing some of the characters later, I haven't really drawn in a while and a little refreshing would do me great I'm sure.

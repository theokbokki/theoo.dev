<p>Lately, I've been trying to write more, and it has been going alright. At first, it was really hard, I was second guessing myself a lot and it all felt very messy.<br />
But slowly, my brain started to change. Now, as I go about my day, I have ideas that pop up into my mind, a sentence that fits very well with what I want to
say or an example to explain some concept.<br />
In the beginning, I was trying to remember stuff, then I started writing it down in my notes app, but I feel like it's time I go one step further and start writing posts on my phone.</p>
<p>So I went on a little bit of a hunt to find a perfect setup. What I do is I sync the markdown files in iCloud Drive, and edit it in an app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/subtext/id1606625287">Subtext</a><sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>. This way I have the same content on my phone and on my computer and I can write from anywhere!</p>
<p>If you also write things, I would be pleased to <a href="mailto:hello@theoo.dev">chat with you</a> about methods for writing :))</p>

<p>It's a free app that allows you to open and edit .txt files from any folder on your phone. It is really similar to textedit.&#160;<a href="#fnref1:1" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">&#8617;</a></p>

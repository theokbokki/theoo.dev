<h2>What happened this week</h2>
<ul>
<li>We had our first day where Neko didn't poo or pee inside the house at all!!!</li>
<li>I added a theme picker and a rss feed to this website, let me know what your favourite color theme is 👩‍🎨</li>
<li>I'm feeling quite tired and for the first time in my life can't wait to be on holiday next week. I have no clue what I'm gonna do during that time apart from sleeping and watching Gilmore Girls.</li>
<li>I finally called my grandparents and was really pleased to hear from them :)) I learned that they once had a dog! For 2 days only, but that still counts right?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Links of the week</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kira.eight45.net/deconstruction-mindset.html">http://kira.eight45.net/deconstruction-mindset.html</a><br />
Nice article about a world perspective that I'm trying to have more and more. Trash isn't always trash and can be repurposed to do other cool things.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the only link this week, I haven't been on the internet much, Gilmore Girl has been my top priority ^^ (Which is a shame since I have a whole <a href="http://kira.eight45.net/deconstruction-mindset.html">internet phone book</a> waiting for me).</p>
<h2>What i watched this week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gilmore Girls<br />
Finished the first season and it was a blast. My two favourite characters rn are Michel and Luke. I'm so glad I still have 6 seasons to go 🍂</li>
</ul>
<h2>What i listened to this week</h2>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I only really listened to one thing, a playlist I'm currently curating called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5QYiTdjH6hVYh2RCkCYhpp?si=9e171063ef694ab7"><em>La grignotte</em></a><sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> which is basically 90s style French hip hop. (ATK, Starflam, Oxmo, Scred Connexion,...).<br />
I've been in the mood for this type of music for the past couple weeks for some reason 🤷‍♀️. Generally autumn is the period where I listen to Stupeflip the most, but not this time it looks like.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAjFIDxsUqc&amp;list=RDRAjFIDxsUqc&amp;start_radio=1">Jyeuhair realeased a new song</a> and I think it's quite a good one! You should definitely check it out.</p>
<h2>What i designed this week</h2>
<p>I made some cool buttons, very inspired by <a href="https://tomthings.fr/">Tom Things</a>.</p>

<p>Would be translated to something like <em>The snacking</em>  in english. I've named it that cause I was hungry for Speculoos at the time.&#160;<a href="#fnref1:1" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">&#8617;</a></p>

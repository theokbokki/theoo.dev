▓ Wednesday 29th October
    
    Morning was chill, walked the dog, made my coffee, and then worked on this website. I finished writing a note about the fact that it's hard to prioritize things in the time we are given, moved all my snippets from the old branch on the github repo to the current website, fixed a few typos or missing metas here and there.
This blog has really been a blast to work on. The "manual" nature of it where everything is basically html makes it feel so simple! I have nothing to think about appart from writing the actual things I want to write and that's lovely.
    
    I also watered my plants which I hadn't done in way too long! I used to have so many of them, but my cats killed a bunch and thrips killed another bunch. I must say that this has really discouradged me from taking care of the ones left but I do it still cause they are living things you know. 
After that, I went to get a package for my SO, a signed copy of the vynil of Miki's latest album. It's a good album and the vinyl comes with a keychain in the shape of a computer with a SD card inside which I think is a nice touch! We are going to see her live in December and I'm sure that it's going to be a fire concert :))
On my way there I crossed path with Taïaut, a cute and kinda crazy dog that I often encouter when walking Neko. His dude is a nice dude, he sometimes gives kibbles to Neko though she's super affraid as always.
At the library (where the package was dropped), I found a book that seemed nice, it's about a doctor who doesn't prescribe medicine but rather cats! So I took the book home with me.
Before midday, we watched the latest "Qui est l'imposteur" video by Squeezie with Kyan Khojandi and Alexandre Astier and I almost got them all wrong. It's soon going to be Halloween and I can't wait to see what video all the youtubers are gonna upload! Generally Halloween videos are some of the best :))

    The afternoon went by rather quick, I went to get some groceries, mostly spinach and "Pommes Pin" for tonight's dinner. I went to Aldi, and for some reason, the people in the queue there alays smell so bad OMG. I don't get how it's possible, but it is always the case. That said, maybe I smell bad as well and I simply don't notice... I wonder. 
After that I came home and went for a quick walk with Neko, then washed the dishes while my SO was doing some shopping. She brought back a book for me which is a really nice gesture of her, she's good with gifts (A talent I wish I could steal sometimes). It's a book about cats that run a mobile cafe and the side of the pages is all deep blue, I love it!
We then proceeded to wash Neko, which she hates, and it was at the same time hard and cute. She was slipping around in the shower and was shaking cause of the cold. So we made it quick and after that she was going all crazy running everywhere in the house, mostly trying to grab her tail that keeps getting away from her face as she turns around for some reason!

    It was then time for another walk, a long one this time, so we went in the Laveu, which I think has some of the most beautiful houses in Liège and I also like the ambiance. Neko was pretty nice and accepted to walk most of the way there, she only stopped at some point while climbing a street (she really doesn't like going uphill it seems) but we crossed path with a tiny chihuahua and were good to go again ^^.
We were supposed to be home by 17:30, so naturally, at 17:20 we were at the furthest point away from home of the whole walk. Fortunatelly, it was the downhill time and Neko loves to run downhill, so we ran all the way home and were able to be back late by only 7 minutes! We were both really tired but it has always been a dream of mine to go for a run with a dog by my side so hey, thanks for that Neko :))
The reason why we had to be back by that time was to watch today's Start Academy!! (You are going to be hearing about that for the next 3 month, I warned you). Nothing much to say except that it's impressive the amount of stuff they are able to learn in such a short span of time. Like come on, one day to learn a song, how to sing it and a little staging to go along is not enough in my opinion.
I'm really shocked by the amount of ads there are in a TV program. We don't have the cable so we never usually watch TV and rather watch videos on youtube or movies/series on Netflix. I also am so sad about how uncreative the ads are, it's hella lame and I hate it!

   Then I went to get some fries!!! I had been dreaming about them since midday and couldn't wait any longer. I took the tram and when I got there was greeted by an empty line, which very rarely happens because they are situated in the city center and almost always have people. 
But when I got in, all my dreams fell appart. The dude behind the counter tells me that they don't have veggie poulycroc anymore... Disaster, sadness and dread fill every part of my body. Maybe I'm being a little dramatic, but that meant that all I was gonna eat for dinner were some fries! Which don't get me wrong, is fantastic, but the poulycroc really ties it all together usually.
After me, a girl came to order just a single cheese croquette, which I thought was a funny order (A good order though, cheese croquettes are great). Then she went back with it in a little paper and I imagined her eating it like a little rodent. Holding it with both hands and taking tiny tiny bites.
Finally I came home and we ate the fries while watching GILMORE GIIIIIIIIIRLS! OMG it had been so long, what a perfect evening. I love that show so so so so much, Luke is my favourite and I wish to be like a 1/1000000% like him. We are at season two still and going through it way too slowly for my taste, but what a great series!

    After that we did our evening routine then went to bed and read a book for an hour or so. My SO has a tiny lamp you can attach to the book that makes a perfectly cosy orange light, the dog was laying at our feet snoring away, it was perfect.
The book I'm reading currently is "Le Vivant comme modèle" by Gauthier Chapelle. I'm enjoying it but have only gone through 50 or so pages so far. It has some interesting ideas and you can really tell that the dude is passionate about the subject, I like it.

▓ Tuesday 28th October

    This is the begining of my journal! So hi to whoever is reading this ^^
I'm currently on holiday so I'm taking things easy. This morning after walking Neko and making my coffee, I finished and published this website!
Then we went to get another coffee at Kawa, this coffee shop is only open during the week when I work so I was happy to go there. But since they changed location, they stopped making filter coffee. So I was dissapointed and didn't take anything there.

    Instead, we went to this other coffee I had meant to try for years, Grand Maison. The place is super cool and I love their website, it's simple but really cute. Also, they accept dogs, and that's a great plus!!! There, they do make filter coffee, and it was great. Chocolatey and not bitter at all, a bit too watery for my taste but nothing too bad.
I hope to go there again soon and maybe we can sit inside this time, the place looks super nice and the staff was lovely.

    After that, we got caught in the rain while coming home. But it was like you know, this super wet rain, the kind of thin, cold, hard hitting, spitty rain. I know it might seem dumb to call rain wet, but I swear that some rain is wetter than some other rain. Come to Belgium for a year, you'll see.
Neko hates the rain and being wet, but she was brave and kept walking and being nice even when we took the tram. I'm really happy about the way she's growing and I feel like most of the worries I had in the first few weeks are now behind me :))

    For dinner, I had gnocchi with bell pepper, tomato paste, cream and a plentifull amount of garlic. It was great, the texture was perfect. After that I finished house cleaning, went to get groceries for tonight's dinner and a carrot cake.
Then there was more walking with Neko but this time she was awful because she'd found some food and wouldn't accept to go anywhere else than where the food was. So we cut it short and went home with loads of pulling and kibble throwing.

    By the time I came home, it was basically time to watch today's Star Academy summary. I'm almost ashamed to say it, but I'm starting to like this show more and more. There is still some hate watching, like, I still critique everything like I know better and it's a lot of fun. My favourite rn is Victor but tbh it's not like a real real favourite, I wouldn't care who wins, I'm not that invested (yet).

    Tonight we are eating fried rice with kimchi (I'm making it as I write these lines), I love this meal, it tastes super good, the vinegary taste of it is on point and yayyy more garlic!!

    Now (Yeah time moved between the previous sentence and this one) we are watching the animated series "Haunted Hotel". I've only seen the first episode so far but I quite like it. I've always enjoyed these kind of dark but fun but adult but childish series, and I'm a big fan of cartoon stuff. I might try my hand at drawing some of the characters later, I haven't really drawn in a while and a little refreshing would do me great I'm sure.
